# Welcome to my GitHub page!

Hi! 
I'm Thomas,
I'm a business analytics professional with experience in working with marketing, product and sales teams and data. I love to leverage data for growth and go-to-market strategies.
Here, I showcase various data analysis projects I've worked on in my free time.
The more recent projects are done with the help of Claude Code which is am amazing tool when it comes to modelling and programming. I also played around with GitHub CoPilot here and there.


## Featured projects:
  ### [Marketing Cockpit](https://github.com/Goldvarg/marketing-cockpit)
  I used ChatGPT to create dummy marketing data and worked on the following projects with that data: 
  - Marketing Mix Model (MMM) built with Google's open-source Meridian MMM.
  - A Multi-Touch Attribution Model and Predictive Analytics for channel-based revenue forecasting.

  ### [Reddit Drama Predictor](https://github.com/Goldvarg/reddit-drama-predictor)
  I worked with Claude Code to build a ML prediciton model to see if I could predict whether a Reddid post will be judged negatively by the community based on the words in the post. 
  Built using real data from r/AmITheAsshole (AITA), one of Reddit's most drama-prone subreddits where users describe something they did or that happened to them and ask the community whether in that particular situation they are the asshole. 

  ### [Stock Price Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/Goldvarg/stock-performance-dashboard)
  I vibe coded a minimalistic dashboard pulling up-to-date stock market data from yahoo and calculating the top 3 winners and losers for the selected time period. 
  All the features are written into one html file with inline script.
