# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Thomas Goldvarg

I'm a Senior Business Analyst with a background in performance marketing, growth analytics, and go-to-market strategy. I build data-driven systems that drive measurable business results â€“ from campaign attribution models to real-time KPI dashboards.

In this portfolio, I document selected personal projects at the intersection of marketing, data, and AI.
