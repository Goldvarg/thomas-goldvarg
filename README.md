# Welcome to my GitHub page!

Hi! 
I'm Thomas,
I'm a business analytics professional with experience in working with marketing, product and sales teams and data. I love to leverage data for growth and go-to-market strategies.
Here, I showcase various data analysis projects I've worked on in my free time.
The more recent projects are done with the help of Claude Code which is am amazing tool when it comes to modelling and programming. I also played around with GitHub CoPilot here and there.


## Featured projects:
  ### Marketing Cockpit (https://github.com/Goldvarg/marketing-cockpit)
  I used ChatGPT to create dummy marketing data and worked on the following projects with that data: 
  - Marketing Mix Model (MMM) built with Google's open-source Meridian MMM.
  - A Multi-Touch Attribution Model and Predictive Analytics for channel-based revenue forecasting.
